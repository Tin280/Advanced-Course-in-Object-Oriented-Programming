1. The structure of classes:

Define two distinct classes, EditableBook and Book.
The book will have read-only details regarding the title, publisher, year of publication, and other details.
Inheriting from Book, EditableBook will add new fields or methods to modify book-related data. Only library employees should be able to enroll in this course.

2. Invariants of Classes:

Book: The object's data must be consistent and accurately represent the information found in the book.
EditableBook: Data integrity must be preserved during modifications in addition to Book invariants (e.g., publishing year cannot be negative).

3. Systems:
A. Library Customer:
Only the Book class will engage with customers.
Book objects will be created by library code for read-only features like search results.
Customers can only access information from public books thanks to this.
B. Library Staff:

Both the Book and EditableBook classes will be available to staff members.
Staff members must first obtain a Book object (array or list) from the database in order to modify a book.
After that, (assuming appropriate access control) they will cast it to an EditableBook object. Staff credentials can be verified during the casting process using a secure approach.
After casting, employees can amend the underlying data structure and change the editable fields.

4.Consequences:

Features of the class:
Book: Provides read-only access points to book details.
EditableBook: Contains access control checks and all the features of a book plus additional editing options (such as changing the publisher, title, etc.).

Class Invariant: Preserves the accuracy of the data for both classes.
Additional verification of valid data may be required during updates in EditableBook.

Usage:
Customers can only search and view book information.
Staff can search, view, and edit book information after proper authentication.
